                                In our urban and suburban houses what should we do without cats> In our sitting or bedrooms, our libraries, in our kitchens and storerooms, our farms, barns, and rickyards, in our corn markets, meat markets, and other places too numerous to mention, how useful they are. In our ships, however, the rats off set them at defiance; stil they are of great service. </p><br>

                               <p> How wonderfully patient is the cat when watching for rats or mice, awaiting their egress from their places of refuge or that which is their home. How well shakespeare in Percies, Act iii, describes this keen attention of the cat to its natural pusuit.</p><br>

                                    Aslight rustle, and the fugitive comes forth a quick sharp resolutr mption and the cat has proved its usefullness. Let any one have a plague pf rats and mice, as I once had, and let them be delivered therefrom by cats, as I was and they will have a lasting and kind regard for them.
