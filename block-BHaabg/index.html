                            If you're not familiar with sport, the term may come as a bit of a conundrum to you, but rest assured, it does not refer to a farmyard animal
                            Those who use social media may have happened across the term 'GOAT' being used in association with the best sports starts in the world.

                            Roger Federer, Usain Bolt, Tom Brady and LeBron James are just some of the names that have been branded the GOAT.

                            The likes of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are also regularly present on similar lists of elite-level athletes.

                            GOAT (or G.O.A.T.) is an acronym which stands for 'greatest of all time'. It is a tag which is reserved for the individual who is deemed to be the undisputed master of their sport.

                            As well as exceptional talent, in order to be considered the GOAT, the individual must also maintain a consistent high level of achievement.

                            While it has been in use for a long time, the term was popularised in the 20th century by heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali, who, in 1964, declared himself "the greatest" after defeating Sonny Liston.

                            It subsequently became a moniker for Ali throughout his career and he famously revisited the catchphrase after defeating George Foreman by knockout, against the odds, in 1974.
